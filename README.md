# Learning-Python-The-Hard-Way
A compilation of examples I am using to learn Python from the book: Learning Python The Hard Way by Zed Shaw

Please note that the examples contained in this repo. Are NOT my own they are the property of the Books creator 'Zed Shaw'. They are simply part of a goal I have set in order to learn and improve my Python skills and I have put them here as a personal backup of the notes I have made.
